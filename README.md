# AI Flash Cards

**Lightning-fast AI insights, sourced fresh daily.**

## ðŸŽ¯ The Problem

The AI landscape is overwhelming. With hundreds of blogs, research papers, and news sources covering AI breakthroughs, it's nearly impossible to stay updated and identify what truly matters. Information overload makes it difficult to:

- **Stay ahead** of the latest AI developments
- **Filter signal from noise** in the vast AI content landscape  
- **Find relevant information** on specific AI topics quickly
- **Consume content efficiently** without spending hours reading

## ðŸ’¡ The Solution

AI Flash Cards delivers latest news on AI breakthroughs & releases as swipeable cards. 

There are hundreds or thousands of blogs on AI providing news about AI releases and what people are doing. This project aims at solving this problem. It utilizes RSS feeds from trusted sources like Hugging Face, OpenAI, Hacker News, DeepMind, Microsoft, NVIDIA, AWS, arXiv, MIT.edu - fetches latest blogs, applies LLM powered filtering to figure out relevance and serves you the top 10 most relevant articles every day. Also provides search functionality to provide latest on any AI-related topic - this is done with help of semantic search on precomputed vectors on sources.

## âœ¨ What Makes It Special

- **ðŸŽ¯ Smart AI Filtering**: Automatically filters hundreds of AI sources to find the most relevant content
- **âš¡ Lightning Fast**: Get insights in seconds, not hours of reading through countless blogs
- **ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Summaries**: Each card includes TL;DR, summary, and "why it matters"
- **ðŸ”„ Daily Updates**: Fresh content sourced from 9+ trusted AI sources (RSS Feeds)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Azure OpenAI service
- Azure AI Search service
- Azure Storage Account (for Azure Files)

### Local Development

1. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo>
   cd AI-Flash-Cards
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure environment**:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Azure credentials
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

4. **Access the app**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:8000
   - API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Azure Deployment

1. **Create Azure resources**:
   - Azure OpenAI service
   - Azure AI Search service
   - Azure Web App

2. **Configure Azure Web App**:
   - Set environment variables in App Settings
   - Mount Azure Files share to `/data` path
   - Deploy code via GitHub Actions or Azure CLI

3. **Initialize database**:
   ```bash
   # Run once to create tables and index
   python -m backend.database init
   ```

## Architecture
